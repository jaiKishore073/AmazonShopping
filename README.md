1. Browser invoked using webdriver manager class which does not require .exe file.
2. Passed amazon url in the chrome browser.
3. Searched "dress" in amazon searchbar.
4. Selected the second in the result section.
5. Selected quantity and size, also stored the price and product name in string.
6. Added the product to the cart and asserted the product name and price with the string already saved.
7. Clicked on proceed to buy which redirected to the login page.
8. Took a screenshot and saved it in *eclipse-workspace\AmazonShopping\.

The project was built in eclipse IDE. If had given sufficient time, I would have used TestNG framework for better code usability.
